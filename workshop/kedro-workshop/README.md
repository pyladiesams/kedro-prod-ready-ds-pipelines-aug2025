## Get started for the Kedro workshop!

## Clone this repo locally

```
git clone https://github.com/pyladiesams/kedro-prod-ready-ds-pipelines-aug2025.git
```

## Install dependencies

Declare any dependencies in `requirements.txt` for `pip` installation.

To install them, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run your Kedro pipeline

You can run your Kedro project with:

```
kedro run
```

Without modifying any code, it's expected the pipeline run will fail with the following error:

```
ValueError: Pipeline contains no nodes after applying all provided filters
```

At this point you're all set for the workshop.
