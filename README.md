# Data science that ships: production-ready pipelines with Kedro

## Workshop description
In this hands-on workshop, we'll refactor a typical data science notebook into a well-structured Kedro project, exploring its core features and workflow and software engineering best practices.

See the [workshop README](workshop/kedro-workshop/README.md) for more instructions on how to get started.
The `solutions` directory contains the solutions to the exercises.
